*jumptree.txt*	|undo-tree| semantics for the |jumplist|

OVERVIEW						*jumptree*

This plugin provides a set of four mappings for navigating the |jumplist|
that are analogous to those for navigating the |undo-tree|. The result is a
consolidation of the |jumplist-stack| and classic |jumplist|:

	- Relative locations of jumplist entries are preserved, as with the
	  |jumplist-stack| when 'jumpoptions' includes "stack";
	- No jumplist entries are discarded, as with the classic |jumplist|
	  when 'jumpoptions' does not include "stack".

MAPPINGS						*jumptree-mappings*

The mappings provided are best illustrated as a correspondence between them
and equivalent jumplist bindings and analogous undo tree bindings:

			Jumptree	   Jumplist		Undo Tree ~
			Default		Stack	Classic		Analogue ~
<Plug>JumptreeUp	CTRL-O		CTRL-O			u	
<Plug>JumptreeDown	CTRL-I		CTRL-I			CTRL-R	
<Plug>JumptreeOlder	g CTRL-O		CTRL-O		g-	
<Plug>JumptreeNewer	g CTRL-I		CTRL-I		g+	


Default mappings can be disabled with
